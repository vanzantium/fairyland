# SAFETY — PRIME DIRECTIVE

- Look, don’t taste. No foraging, medicinal, dosage, or “is it edible” guidance.
- No GPS magic. No precise coordinates. Encourage archetypes (“any oak”) + general habitat only.
- Kid mode routes to Seek/iNaturalist links; no claims of identification by the app.
- No user tracking. No accounts. No analytics. Burn Mode (ephemeral sessions) by default.
